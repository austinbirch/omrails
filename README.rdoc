Shit to do:
* Cannot get simple_form to play nice with Bootstrap 3 form classes.
* Cannot get Devise to play nice with Rails 4. Have added code to application_controller to allow me to capture name on signup (and this works), but cannot add a name to an existing user profile. Flash tells me profile was updated successfully, but if you view the profile again the name field is blank. Would these help:

* Make the flashes look better using Gritter - https://github.com/RobinBrouwer/gritter.
